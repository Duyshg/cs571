	Abstract = {Distributional Semantic word representation allows Natural Language Processing systems to extract and model an immense amount of information about a language. This technique maps words into a high dimensional continuous space through the use of a single-layer neural network. This process has allowed for advances in many Natural Language Processing research areas and tasks. These representation models are evaluated with the use of analogy tests, questions of the form ``If a is to a' then b is to what?'' are answered by composing multiple word vectors and searching the vector space.

During the neural network training process, each word is examined as a member of its context. Generally, a word's context is considered to be the elements adjacent to it within a sentence. While some work has been conducted examining the effect of expanding this definition, very little exploration has been done in this area. Further, no inquiry has been conducted as to the specific linguistic competencies of these models or whether modifying their contexts impacts the information they extract.

In this paper we propose a thorough analysis of the various lexical and grammatical competencies of distributional semantic models. We aim to leverage analogy tests to evaluate the most advanced distributional model across 14 different types of linguistic relationships. With this information we will then be able to investigate as to whether modifying the training context renders any differences in quality across any of these categories. Ideally we will be able to identify approaches to training that increase precision in some specific linguistic categories, which will allow us to investigate whether these improvements can be combined by joining the information used in different training approaches to build a single, improved, model.},

	Abstract = {Computational semantics as a field includes many of the unsolved problems of Natural Language Processing. The need for innovation in this field has motivated much research in developing word and language models that better represent meaning and various concepts within semantics. This thesis is concerned specifically with measuring verb similarity and verb clustering, a task within this field. The goal is to develop representations of verbs that can accurately and viably be used to judge semantic similarity between verbs and to group verbs into classes that reflect their relatedness in meaning. Verb clustering - a task of distributing verbs into semantically related classes - has in previous research been shown to have applications in multiple tasks in Natural Language Processing including word sense disambiguation. This thesis will present and compare several methods of automatic acquisition of verb similarity, with a goal of allowing future applications of these methods in NLP tasks and to promote discoveries in how the mechanisms modeled by these methods relate to linguistics.

This paper presents several methods from verb clustering based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation - a probabilistic graphical model commonly used for topic modelling. We model verbs as collections of contextual features derived from latent classes. LDA, which is designed as a model for Bayesian inference of latent thematic categories, fits well to model verb classes based on linguistic context. We demonstrate Recursive LDA, a procedure of executing LDA iteratively to produce a hierarchical structure of classes. We test several linguistic features from syntax and lexical arguments of verbs with interest in identifying how informative each feature is. We evaluate all of our experiments against human judgments of similarity providing a novel method for evaluating semantic similarity metrics of word models. We test all of our data on a list of 3,000 most common English verbs.

We test our method against Word2Vec, a popular and recently developed word model using skip-gram feature vectors refined by deep learning. The results in this thesis will show that given the right features, our method of using LDA with linguistic features outperforms Word2Vec's data-driven statistical approach when weighed against human judgements.},

	Abstract = {Word embedding has drastically changed the field of natural language processing and has become the norm for distributional semantic models. Previous methods for generating word embeddings did not take advantage of the semantic information in sentence structures. In this work we create a new approach to word embedding that leverages structural data from sentences to produce higher quality word embeddings. We also introduce a framework to evaluate word embeddings from any part of speech. We use this framework to assess the quality of word embeddings produced with different semantic contexts and show that sentence structure is rich with semantic information. Our evaluations show that our new word embeddings far out preform the original word embeddings in all parts of speech. Furthermore we examine the task of sentiment analysis in order to demonstrate the superiority of our system's word embeddings.},
