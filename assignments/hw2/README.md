**Important** Here are things you should notice before start your hw2.

1. Each homework is structured as a python package. If you are using IDE, such as PyCharm, please open a new project and use [hw2](.) as your project **ROOT** directory; otherwise, the package import path will be incorrect. 
2. Please develop everything based on the given class. **Do not** delete existing methods, modify inheritance, remove the given parameters. You can add new functions no matter outside or inside the class. You just need to make sure everything can be run in the container successfully.
