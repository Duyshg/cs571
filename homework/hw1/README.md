Hashtag Segmentation
=====

Hashtags found in social media do not include whitespaces, which make them hard to interpret. Your task is to write a program that takes a list of hashtags and returns a list of token lists representing the most likely sequences of the input hashtags (e.g., `'#therealdeal'` &rarr; `['the', 'real', 'deal']`)
